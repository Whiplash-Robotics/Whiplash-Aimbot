# Whiplash - real life aim machine

**Status:** Very heavily under construction 🚧  
**Start Date:** December 1, 2024
**Last Updated:** March 21, 2025

This project is an ambitious undertaking to create a _real-life aim machine_—a physical device that moves a mouse to click on targets as quickly and accurately as possible. We aim to push the boundaries of hardware, software, and real-time interaction with a custom-built system.

### **Goals**

1. **Develop Our Own Game**  
   A game designed specifically to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of the aim machine.
2. **Assemble Custom Hardware**  
   Build a physical setup capable of precise and rapid movements to replicate human mouse control.
3. **Implement Computer Vision**  
   Create algorithms to detect and track game elements in real-time.
4. **Write Control Software**  
   Design software to integrate the hardware, computer vision, and game logic seamlessly.

### **Current Progress**

The project is in its very early stages, with planning, research, and initial prototyping underway.
