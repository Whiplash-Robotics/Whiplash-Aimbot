## Objectives

Whiplash is built on the basis of inhuman precision - performance is our top priority. Choosing the right model through research and testing is key to keeping latency low, accuracy high, and computational costs reasonable.

_Every millisecond matters, and every missed flick is a failure._

### Benchmarks

We've set the following performance standards to aim for:

- Computational effiency: >120 FPS on a RTX 3060 or equivalent GPU without major CPU bottlenecks
- Accuracy: At least 90% precision in target acquisition
- Response time: less than 50ms latency from target detection to servo actuation

### Roadmap

We'll start by leveraging pre-trained models from the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family, assessing their viability in real-time scenarios, as it's been deployed in many real-time critical industrial use cases already. If these models either fall short of our performance benchmarks or, conversely, prove effective but leave room for further optimization, we'll pivot to training our own CNN - either as a last resort or as an experiment to push Whiplash's capabilities even further.
