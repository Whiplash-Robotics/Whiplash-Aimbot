## Goal
The aim of this projectâ€™s game engine is to provide a fully customizable environment and to have the ability to integrate smoothly with all other sections of this project.

## Choices
When it comes down to which game engine to choose it is narrowed down to three options based solely on the extensive resources and documentation provided along with them:
Godot, Unreal, and Unity.

*Note: all three are free*

### Godot, GDScript, C++ and C
Lightweight open source engine,
(released under the permissive MIT license).<br />
Insufficiently supported by tutorials and assets. <br />

*Thought recently more and more have been released, as of now it is insufficient.*

### Unreal, C++
Intensive source-available engine.<br />
Extensive asset library.<br />
Very scalable in the sense that we can do extreme open world (and more detailed graphics and effects) enabled by powerful rendering with Nanite, internal mesh format and rendering tech.

### Unity, C#
Often considered less optimized for very large, complex 3D world.<br />
Alongside Unreal Engine, Unity is also an industry standard.

## Conclusion
For our non-commercial purposes, as well as the non demand for advanced features choosing any of the three would be an acceptable decision. However, as of this moment Unreal Engine seems to hold more potential.
**So we choose Unreal Engine**
