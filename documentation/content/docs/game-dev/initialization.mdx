## Overview

Quick guide on how to set up [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) to open the game project. The reason behind the choice of game engine can be found [here](../research-development-software/engine)

## Cloning the game:

    #### For Developers

    Note: git LFS must be installed on your devices to clone the repository. If it is not installed, please follow the ensuing instructions:

    1. If a previous version of the repo exists on your device locate and delete the repo on your local computer

    2. In command line (terminal or powershell):

    ```sh
    git lfs install
    ```

    3. Clone the repo (cloning may take a few minutes)

    #### For Players

    1. In command line, run: git lfs install

    2. Clone the repo to your directory (cloning may take a few minutes)


## Set up

1. Download and install [Epic Games Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download)

2. Open the launcher and navigate: <br /> Unreal Engine > Library > Click the plus sign > Add Unreal Engine 4.27.2 > Install

3. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), this step is required to open the project as it uses C++

4. Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net481-developer-pack-offline-installer)

5. Go to folder in Whiplash and double click the .uproject | Alternativley, open Unreal Engine Editor and directly browse the path to the .uproject file

6. If you encounter the following error: <br /> `The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version: game_environment` <br /> Click Yes to rebuild them

7. After rebuilding the game should run in Unreal Engine Editor.

## Troubleshooting

1. If git-lfs is not installed, you may encounter the following error: <br/>
   `git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.`<br/>
   To fix this, you need to install git-lfs which can be done with the following:

```sh title="Windows"
choco install git-lfs
# OR
scoop install git-lfs
```

```sh title="MacOS"
brew install git-lfs
```

```sh title="Linux"
sudo apt install git-lfs  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install git-lfs  # Fedora
sudo pacman -S git-lfs    # Arch

# Alternativley you can install from
[Git LFS website] (https://git-lfs.github.com/)
```

2. If clicking "Yes" during the rebuild failed, you may not have installed [.NET Framework 4.8.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net481-developer-pack-offline-installer) correctly.
