## Overview

A timing belt is like a pulley with geared teeth that allow for precise and extremely fast movements without slipping. A timing belt is essential for ensuring the accurate and coordinated movement of the aim machine's mechanical components. This synchronization is vital for achieving the high precision and speed required to move the mouse and click on targets effectively.

### Importance in Whiplash Project

1. **Precision**: Ensures that the mechanical parts of the aim machine move in a highly controlled and precise manner, which is critical for accurate targeting.
2. **Synchronization**: Maintains the correct timing between different components, preventing misalignment and ensuring smooth operation.
3. **Durability**: Made from high-tensile materials, the timing belt can withstand the rapid and repetitive movements required by the aim machine.
4. **Efficiency**: Contributes to the overall efficiency of the system by reducing the risk of mechanical errors and enhancing performance.

## Options

### GT2 Timing Belt

- **Pros:**
  - Commonly used in precision applications like 3D printers and CNC machines
  - Readily available and affordable
- **Cons:**
  - May stretch slightly under high loads

### HTD5M Timing Belt (Steel-Reinforced Polyurethane)
- **Pros:**
  - Designed for higher torque applications
  - More resistant to stretching compared to GT2
- **Cons:**
  - Slightly more expensive
  - Has more backlash, which could affect precision in small movements

## Selection
We went with the **HTD 5M Timing Belt** since we didnâ€™t mind the slight chance of backlash and wanted something that could reliably operate under high stress and handle torque well.

## Pulley
Based off of the timing belt we chose, we bought a HTD5M 20 teeth pulley with a bore of 6.35mm which shoudl be perfect for the motor.

## Next steps
- Wait for the HTD5M timing belt to arrive and test its performance under different loads and speeds  
- Monitor belt wear and adjust tension as needed
