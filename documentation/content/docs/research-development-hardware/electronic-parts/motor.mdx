## Overview

A motor is required to drive the [H-bot](../../design/linear-translation#overview). The motor needs to be cheap and powerful, but we dont need it to be small or super precise since we plan on having active real time adjustments.

### Torque

#### Acceleration

The motor needs to be able to move the mouse across the `~350mm` surface with an initial target of `100ms`.
The motor will be mounted to a pulley that will pull the [Timing Belt](../mechanical-parts/timing-belt). The acceleration will be constant up to `50ms`, and then reverse from `50ms` to `100ms`.
This is to ensure that we are accelerating as long as possible, thus not wasting time but also allowing enough time to accelerate in the other direction.

The formula for acceleration given time and final displacement can be found by:

```math
\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
t &= 50\,\text{ms},\\[8pt]
\Delta d_1 &= \frac{1}{2} a t^2,\\[8pt]
\Delta d_2 &= v_{f1} t - \frac{1}{2} a t^2,\\[8pt]
\Delta d &= \Delta d_1 + \Delta d_2,\\[8pt]
\Delta d &= \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + a t^2 - \frac{1}{2} a t^2,\\[8pt]
a &= \frac{0.35}{t^2} = \frac{0.35}{0.05^2} = 140\,\text{m/s}^2.
\end{aligned}

```

#### Force

The force required to move the mouse is proportional to the mass of the object. The expected mass given the weight of the [linear guide rail](../mechanical-parts/linear-guide-rail) is 400g, so the force can be calculated by:

```math

\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
F_a &= m \cdot a,\\[8pt]
F_a &= 0.4 \cdot 140 = 56\,\text{N}.
\end{aligned}

```

#### Finding Torque

Using the formula found in the image below:

![Image](./pulleydemo.webp)

we find that the formula for torque is simply:

```math
\tau = rF_a
```

with a radius on the pulley of about `30mm`, the torque is **1.68Nm**

## Speed

Since our goal is `350mm` in `100ms`, we need a peak tangential velocity of

```math

v_t = at = 140 \cdot 0.05 = 7m/s

```

then to get the angular velocity:

```math

\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
v_t &= \omega r,\\[8pt]
\omega &= \frac{v_t}{0.03},\\[8pt]
\omega &= \frac{7}{0.03} = 233.33\,\text{ rad/s} = 2228\,\text{ rpm}.
\end{aligned}

```

Well, more like _option_ (singular). After searching far and wide for many hours, almost every motor either has a crazy shipping fee, way too underpowered, too expensive, or too overpowered. Except one.

After doing this research, we realized that our goal of 350mm in 100ms might be unfeasible. We found a weaker motor that is less power demanding but should stil be able to deliver on our goal of _inhuman aim_.
