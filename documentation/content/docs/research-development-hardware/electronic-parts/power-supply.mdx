## Overview

<Callout type="warn">
  {" "}
  WARNING! These power supply's deal with deadly high voltage and current. Always take necessary precautions when handling.  

  Some general advice:
  - NEVER touch live wires
  - Only use one hand
  - Wear shoes with rubber soles
  - These are not exhaustive. See an official source [here](https://nistglobal.com/blog/2022/08/safety-precautions-when-working-with-high-voltage-electricity/)

A power supply is required to run the motors. The power supply needs to be affordable, and supply the necessary voltage and current to the motor(s). Since we need two motors, there can also be a consideration of using two smaller power supplies, or one larger one.

## Specifications

The DC motor we selected requires a stable 24V and 20A to operate efficiently. The requirements for the power supply are as follows:
| **PSU Type** | **Smaller** | **Larger** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| **Voltage**  | 24V         | 24V        |
| **Current**  | 20A         | 40A        |
| **Power**    | 480W        | 960W       |
| **Motors**   | 1           | 2          |

## Choice

After considering the options, we decided on getting a Lam(MS)pen 480W power supply. 
We chose this one because it offered good safety features at a good cost.
We also wanted to test our motors without spending too much, so it would pay off more to get a smaller power supply.
